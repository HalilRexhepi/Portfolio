                <p>I am Egzon Sherifi and I've recently graduated from the University "Kadri Zeka" in Gjilan on the Computer Science Faculty. I learned to work with HTML5, CSS3 and with some programming languages like PHP and a little bit of JS in my faculty during projects but I got more advanced skills by researching and attending courses on those specified programming languages.
